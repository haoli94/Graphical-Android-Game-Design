<font face="Cambria">Welcome to our Bunny World Game Play and Editor App! When starting our game, you will be directed to the main page, where you can select the app mode between “Create Game”, “Play Game”, and “Edit Game.” If you choose “Create Game”  by clicking the button, you will be directed to a new activity where you can create a new game. You will also see a spinner on main page, where you can choose an existing game, either to be played or to be edited. If you click the “Edit Game” button, you will also be directed to the activity that you can re-edit the existing game. By choosing “Play Game” button, you can play the game selected in the spinner. How Exciting! Our app will provide a default game called “Bunny World,” so that you can always have a taste of how games are played in the play mode or showed in the edit mode.</font>

<font face="Cambria">Welcome to play the game that you just created or the default game. The play mode will load the game information from the sql table (table name equals game name), then it can draw the shapes on our customized canvas, allowing many fancy effects, including the required effects and many extensions. </font>
